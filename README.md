# Alphabet_python
Tired of your professor asking you to display letters or words in Python? ðŸ˜«
Just use this, and boom! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
You can easily generate letters in your project!

# How does it work?
Place the file in C:\EduPython\App\Lib if you're using EduPython, or simply in the same folder as your project.

Import it using:

```python
from Alphabet import *
```
ðŸ’¢ This line is required for the script to work!

# Getting Started
The program first asks you to define:

- Width â€“ The width of your letters

- Length â€“ The height of your letters

- Y â€“ The vertical margin position

- X â€“ The horizontal margin position

# Writing Letters
To display a letter, type the letter followed by ().
For example, to display "X":

```python
X()
```
To add space between letters, use ``space()``.
To move to the next line, use ``enter()``.

# Example:
Hereâ€™s how you can write the word "WORD" using Alphabet.py:

```python
from alphabet import *

A()
enter()
W()
space()
O()
space()
R()
space()
D()
```
# Planned Updates
âœ” Allow typing letters directly, with space() only required between words.
âœ” Improve my English ðŸ˜…
âœ” Add special characters like ;,.:/ etc.
âœ” Support for numbers! ðŸŽ‰

# Found a bug?
Let me know! There are bound to be a few. ðŸ˜†
