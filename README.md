# Alphabet_python 🧂
Tired of your professor asking you to display letters or words in Python? 😫
Just use this, and boom! 💥💥💥<br>
You can easily generate letters in your project! 🤩

# How does it work? 🤓
Place the file in C:\EduPython\App\Lib if you're using EduPython, or simply in the same folder as your project. 📁

Import it using:

```python
from alphabet import *
```
💢 This line is required for the script to work!

# Getting Started 🐤
The program first asks you to define:

- Width – The width of your letters

- Length – The height of your letters

- Y – The vertical margin position 

- X – The horizontal margin position

# Writing Letters 💻
To display a letter, type the letter followed by ().
For example, to display "X":

```python
X()
```
To add space between words, use ``space()``.
To move to the next line, use ``enter()``.

# Example: 👐
Here’s how you can write the sentence "A WORD FROM ME" using Alphabet.py:

```python
from alphabet import *

A()
enter()
W()
O()
R()
D()
space()
space()
space()
F()
R()
O()
M()
enter()
M()
E()
```
