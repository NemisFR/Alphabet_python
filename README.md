# Alphabet_python
A little module that allows you to write letter using turtle

# How does it works ?
First, the program will ask you to define :
- Width, for the width of your letters
- Length, for the height of your letters
- Y, for the position in the y axis of your margin
- X, for the position in the x axis of your margin

Type the letter you want (here we will use X) followed by ()
This should look like ``X()``
Then, type ``space()``
Space() separate the letter from each other
Once you've type space(), you can type another letter, like ``Y()`` or ``W()``
If you want a word wrap, type ``enter()``

Here's an exemple of a word made with alphabet.py :
```python
from alphabet import*
A()
enter()
W()
space()
O()
space()
R()
space()
D()
```

# Planned update :
- I plan to adjust so that just typing the letter should be enough, and you'll only need ``space()`` to space words
- Improve my english :')
- I plan to add special charachter like ;,.:/ etc...
- I plan to add numbers :D

# Pls don't hesitate to report any bug, cause there will be a lot of them
